if king check four corners 

if spot is nil then add 0 to valid next moves

if spot is nonnil then 
check if not on your team then
check if next spot on same vector is nil 
if it is then its a jump and should write 1 for jump in the valid moves list

if neither |-> add nil 




if the movelist is length 1 and valid next moves is all nil then any of
those moves are valid

if the movelist is length greater than 1 any moves that are nil are invalid 
and are removed from the valid move list

anything that is left is a jump or the list is empty and its time to return


if no valid next moves then append current to movelist and movelist
to piece-movelist and return 0

if there are valid next moves then append current location to movelist and 
call move (piece (modified location) board movelist) for each valid move
